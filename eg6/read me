to run this eg. simply run 
dune build src/file.exe
dune exec src/file.exe


we have specified lib files and src files in different folders and they have different dunes respectively. The dune in the specifies library and source as library and executable respectively. 

the library folder contains the c files and a ml file which specifies the exports of those c files. Dune here calls the c_names over the c libraries and libraries required for the ml file. Specific name is given for this library and used below.

src folder contains only the ml file. its dune is executable type and simply uses the library specified above. 

Dune will be run from the root directory which contains both lib and src and command used is given at the top.
